Utilized MS SQL and Tableau to analyze the advantages brought by AI in both the retail and technology sectors, with a specific emphasis on examining the average profits and how they are distributed among various AI benefits. Inventory optimization emerged as the predominant advantage and stood out as the primary benefit for retail enterprises yielding the highest profits in terms of USD. The data used was from Kaggle and based on the year 2022.
